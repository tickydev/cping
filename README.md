# Compile and change site
To change the site and compile the code, you need to create an empty project in Microsoft Visual Studio (c++ Console application), copy the main(source).cpp file code from my github and paste it into your project, then replace it in line 14 (example.com ) to any other site, when you have done this, you can compile project via a Local Windows Debugger or any other compiler.
